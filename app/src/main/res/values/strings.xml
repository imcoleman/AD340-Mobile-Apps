                            aspiring software developer.  I recently
                            learned how terrifying it is to teach your 15
                            year old to drive. When I\'m not in the passenger
                            seat I enjoy running, music, and gardens.
                            Fun fact: My parents are marine biologists who named
                            a tunicate after my son Alex (<i>Trididemnum alexi</i>).
